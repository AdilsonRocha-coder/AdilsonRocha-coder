Hello!
You have finally discovered my Github profile.
I am still learning HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT. Afterwards I will study PHP and Python. 
My friends and I have developed a program to control a stock for small business (customers, products, suppliers...). This program was developed in C# and used SQLite database.
It was part of our TCC activity.
Please feel free to clone projects and raise issues if you think something could be better.

Happy coding, guys! ðŸ˜Š
